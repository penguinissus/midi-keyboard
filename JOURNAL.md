## 10/4/2025 6 AM - Downloaded KiCad and created project  

Literally what the title says: (re) Downloaded KiCad because updates and created project as a folder.
This took a very insignificant amount of time but since I'm gonna continue everything else later I'll keep the journal separate. 
Did not encounter any difficulties since the project hasn't really started yet.

## 10/4/2025 8 PM - Added pico and switch matrix to schematic  

first part:
added raspberry pi pico to schematic and connected power and ground. 
setup backbone of switch matrix aka just the side of the switch matrix.

second part:
filled in the rest of the switch matrix and renamed all of the switches and diodes so that all the numbers are in order.

## 10/5/2025 - Added rotary encoders  

I Added rotary encoders to the schematic.

Problem encountered:
Realized I may or may not have misinterpreted instructions so I asked for help in #blueprint-support
Fixed and tidied up the way I connected rotary encoders to the matrix:

Labeled all the pins on pico

## 10/6/2025 - Connected everything to pico + annotation  

Connected LCD to raspberry pi pico.

Annotated the entire schematic to separate each section (such as switch matrix, lcd, and rotary encoders), added descriptions of how things work and name of parts to each section.

Added a reset button to the raspberry pi pico.

## 10/7/2025 - Remade switch matrix with actual plan this time  

Realized I forgot to account for all the different kinds of buttons on the original switch matrix so I redid the switch matrix. Labeled the matrix so that it specifies what each button is for. Current plan includes 2 full octaves + 8 semitones, 8 user buttons, and the labels that connect to the rotary encoders.

## 10/9/2025 - Assigned footprints & PCB layout for keyboard  

I assigned all of the footprints for the midi keyboard following the tutorial but there are problems I encountered and will ask in #blueprint-support.

Finished layout of the keyboard part of the PCB. I made a 2.5 octave keyboard because I had extra spots left in the switch matrix.
