## 10/4/2025 6 AM - Downloaded KiCad and created project  

Literally what the title says: (re) Downloaded KiCad because updates and created project as a folder.
This took a very insignificant amount of time but since I'm gonna continue everything else later I'll keep the journal separate. 
Did not encounter any difficulties since the project hasn't really started yet.

second part:
filled in the rest of the switch matrix and renamed all of the switches and diodes so that all the numbers are in order.
