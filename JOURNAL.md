## 10/4/2025 - Downloaded KiCad and created project  

Literally what the title says: (re) Downloaded KiCad because updates and created project as a folder.
This took a very insignificant amount of time but since I'm gonna continue everything else later I'll keep the journal separate. 
Did not encounter any difficulties since the project hasn't really started yet.
